# Pharo wiki manifest

This file will explain the goals of this project and define its boundaries. 

Pharo-wiki is a user maintained wiki on the programming language and development environment Pharo and its ecosystem.

The goals of the project are to provide:

- documentation on parts of Pharo that are not yet or poorly documented;
- a centralized source of information on Pharo;
- pointers to existing documentation;
- tips on possible workflow on Pharo using all the strength of the environment;
- references to external libraries;
- migration guides between differents versions of Pharo.
The project should be easy to contribute to (with a github account the user should just have to edit a file on the github interface to contribute)

To be easy to contribute, this project is written in Markdown and hosted on github. Anyone with a github account can easily provide a Pull Request. (See [Contribution guide](CONTRIBUTION.md))

To achieve these goals, the project is divided into the following sections:

* [Beginners](https://github.com/pharo-open-documentation/pharo-wiki#beginners) - guides for beginners who have just recently discovered Pharo.
* [General](https://github.com/pharo-open-documentation/pharo-wiki#general) - pages describing some of Pharo mechanism and guides on possible workflows.
* [Pharo projects](https://github.com/pharo-open-documentation/pharo-wiki#pharo-projects) - documentation about subprojects contained in the Pharo general distribution.
* [External projects](https://github.com/pharo-open-documentation/pharo-wiki#external-projects) - information about external projects. Most of the pages give some examples to give an idea on how those project work and offer comparisons between multiple projects around the same theme.
* [Migration guidelines](https://github.com/pharo-open-documentation/pharo-wiki#migration-guidelines) - migration guides between different versions of Pharo.
* [External ressources](https://github.com/pharo-open-documentation/pharo-wiki#external-ressources) - links to ressources not maintained by the wiki community but interesting to check-out.

As long as they fit the goals of the wiki, the entries of this project can be:

- documentation
- tutorials
- guides
- tips and tricks
