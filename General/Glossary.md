# Pharo vocabulary
The Pharo community uses specific vocabulary to designate object oriented concepts, Pharo concepts and Pharo tools.

This page aims to provide disambiguation for the words belonging to this vocabulary.

## $a
The character a. In Pharo strings are composed of characters. A character starts with a $. For unprintable characters such as tab, just send the character's name to the class; for example, `Character tab`.

## Binary message
A binary message is a [message](#message) composed of special character(s) where two objects are involved (the [receiver](#receiver) and one argument), which is the reason it is called binary. This is mostly used for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations. For example, `+` is a binary message.

## Bootstrap

## Browser
The browser designates the tool for browsing and editing packages, classes and methods. In Pharo 6.1 and greater, the browser is Calypso.

## Candidates
In the context of a method call, the candidates are the potential classes in the system that can receive the call. This list is computed from a static analysis of the source code.

## Changes (file)
The changes file logs all source code modifications (including all the changes you made while programming) since the [sources file](#sources) was generated. This facilitates a per method history for diffs or reverting. It means that even if you did not save the image file before a crash, you can recover your changes from this file. A changes file is always coupled with an image file. They work as a pair.

> Note: Since Pharo 5, a project called Epicea implementing a new logging system has been introduced in the system. The long term goal of Epicea is to replace the changes file, but this objective has not been reached yet.

## Class side
Each class has a meta-class that contains methods that can be sent directly to the class.
The class side of a class is its meta-class.  
For example, `#x:y:` method (which creates an instance of `Point` with arbitrary x and y coordinates) is held by the meta-class of `Point`.

In Pharo, both `Class` and `MetaClass` understand `#classSide` method.
The class side of a class/meta-class partnership always refers to the meta-class.
For example:

```Smalltalk
Point classSide. "Answers Point class."
Point class classSide. "Also answers Point class."
Point includesSelector: #x:y:. "Answers false."
Point class includesSelector: #x:y:. "Answers true."
```

The best way to understand the class side is to look at implementations of the `#classSide` method:

```Smalltalk
Class>>#classSide
	^ self class
```

```Smalltalk
MetaClass>>#classSide
  ^ self
```

## Cog
*Cog* is the name of the [virtual machine](#virtual-machine) used by Pharo.
It is also used by other programming languages such as [Squeak](#squeak), Newspeak and Cuis.

## Context
A *Context* represents the execution of a program. It stores the `CompiledMethod` being currently executed, the receiver and arguments of the message that invoked this `CompiledMethod`, the temporary variables, the stack of calls until this moment of the execution, ...
In Pharo, you can use the keyword `thisContext` to interact with the current context of your code. It will return the `Context` object at the moment of the execution. This object is different each time the method is called.

## Debugger
The *Debugger* is a tool opened by the system when an exception is raised, but not caught. This tool allows the developer to interact with the execution [context](#context) that raised the error and its previous contexts. It lets the user inspect the objects present in these contexts and use the execution information to help update the code and fix the bug.

## Dispatch
Dispatch is a technique used in object-oriented programming to delegate behavior using [polymorphism](#polymorphism). The goal is to define a concept that will change depending on the context. For example, suppose we have an application with commands. Each object can implement its own behaviour in an `execute` method, using this same method name for every command. When we need to execute a command, instead of using a switch/case, we just call this method.

## DNU
See [DoesNotUnderstand](#doesnotunderstand).

## DoesNotUnderstand
This name designates the error that arises when a [message](#message) is sent to an object, but the object does not understand it. Sometimes people use the acronym "DNU" for this error.

## Iceberg
*Iceberg* is a git client integrated into the system since Pharo 7 (Pharo 6.1 contained a technical preview of the tool). It is a set of tools that allows one to handle git repositories directly from a Pharo image. Iceberg is the default repository manager for Pharo, allowing for smoother and faster integration of contributions, as well as better branch and version management.

## Image
A Pharo image is a snapshot of Pharo memory at a given moment.
This is the file where all objects are stored and as such, itâ€™s a cross-platform format that does not depend on the host operating system.
An image file contains the live state of all objects in the system at a given point.
This includes classes and compiled methods, since they are objects too.
The image can be seen as a virtual object container.

## Implementors
For a given selector in the system, implementors are classes that have a method with this selector (that is, they implement the selector). For example, the implementors of the method `#banana` are all the classes containing a method named `#banana`.

## Inspector
The *Inspector* is a Pharo tool that allows one to inspect objects, see their current state, interact with them and display specific information depending on the object. It offers multiple views and a finder for navigation. One useful feature is that you can use the evaluator tab to enter code, then evaluate it to open another pane to the right to observe the result.

## Instance
An *instance* is an individual object in the system.  In Pharo, each instance has a class, which determines what instance variables the object holds and what messages it responds to.  Each instance can have different values in these variables, and therefore answer the same message differently.  For example, when it receives the message #name, one instance of class Dog might respond `Spot` while another responds `Lassie`.

## Instance side
Each class works as a pair with a meta-class.
The class (the *instance side*) contains methods that can be sent to its instances, and the meta-class (the class side) contains methods that can be sent directly to the class.
For example, #x:y: method (which creates an instance of Point with arbitrary x and y coordinates) is held by the meta-class of Point.

In Pharo, both Class and MetaClass understand #classSide method. The class side of a class/meta-class partnership always refers to the meta-class. For example:

Point classSide. "Answers Point class."
Point class classSide. "Also answers Point class."
Point includesSelector: #x:y:. "Answers false."
Point class includesSelector: #x:y:. "Answers true."

The best way to understand the class side is to look at implementations of the #classSide method:

Class>>#classSide
    ^ self class

MetaClass>>#classSide
  ^ self

## Keyword message
A keyword message is a [message](#message) where two or more objects are involved (the [receiver](#receiver) and the arguments). A message is composed of alphanumeric characters. The arugments are injected inside the message selector and must be proceeded by a colon (`:`). For example, `between:and:` is a keyword message with a receiver and two arguments. It can be used like this: `13 between: 12 and: 14`.

## Late binding

## Lookup
Method lookup is the name of the technique Pharo uses to find the method to execute when an object receive a [message](#message). It proceeds as follows: When a message is sent, methods in the [receiver](#receiver)'s class are searched for a matching method. If no match is found, the superclass is searched, and so on up the superclass chain. In the end if no method is found, the object call the method [`#doesNotUnderstand:`](#doesnotunderstand) with the message as parameter.

## Message
A message represents an interaction between two objects.
A [sender](#sender) sends a message to a [receiver](#receiver) which will start a [lookup](#lookup).
A message is composed of two elements: the selector, which is the name of the method to lookup, and argument values which are the values of each arguments of the method to execute once find by the lookup.
Three kinds of messages exists: [unary messages](#unary-message), [binary messages](#binary-message) and [keyword messages](#keyword-message).

## Message-send

## Monticello
*Monticello* is a distributed versioning system for [Squeak](#squeak) and Pharo code. It was the main versionning system until Pharo 6. It is now recommanded to use [Iceberg](#iceberg).

## Object

## Playground / Workspace

## Polymorphism

## Pragma
Pragmas are annotations on methods. They are used to attach additional properties to the methods to make those methods easily collectable through reflectivity and to ease the creation of special handlings.
A page dedicated to pragmas is available [here](Pragmas.md).

## Primitive
A primitive is a method for which the source code is not written in Smalltalk but directly in C code. From the inside of the image, those methods contain a `<primitive:>` pragma.

Some methods holding this primitive pragma also contain source code written in Smalltalk. For these methods, first the C version of the method is tried but if the implementation in C is not provided by the VM for some reason, Pharo falls back to the smalltalk implementation.

## Protocol
In Pharo, each method belongs to a protocol. A protocol has a name and allows one to group methods that are related together. For example, the protocol `accessing` is widely used in the system to hold accessor and mutator methods.

## Receiver
The receiver of a [message](#message) send is the instance of a class implementing the method corresponding to the message sent receiving this message.

## Selector
A selector corresponds to the signature of a method in the system. Since Pharo is not statically typed, the selector of a method is simply a Symbol. On a CompiledMethod, it is possible to send `#selector` message to retrieve this Symbol.

## Self
Self is the [receiver](#receiver) of a [message](#message) an object sends to itself. This means that the [lookup](#lookup) of a method send will start by the sender of this message then, if not found, it will proceed with its superclass.

## Sender
The sender of a [message](#message) is the object that will send a message to another object. In case the [receiver](#receiver) of a message is [self](#self), then the sender is equal to the receiver.

## Senders
For a given selector in the system, senders are the methods sending a message with this selector. For example, the senders of the method `#banana` are all the methods sending the message `#banana` in their code.

## Sista
Sista is the name of a [virtual machine](#virtual-machine) with adaptive optimisations such as speculative inlining (it means that the Virtual machine tries to guess the type of receiver and arguments and based on this heavily optimises the code at runtime, in case of wrong guess it deoptimises the code). It showed better performance but is still currently under developement. It is not yet production ready.

## Slang
The term "Slang" refers to a subset of the Smalltalk language that can be translated to C (or other language, such as Javascript). It is mainly used to develop the [Cog](#cog) virtual machine. It allows one to develop the virtual machine using Pharo tools and generates C.

## Slot
Instance variables are reified in Pharo, which means they are real objects that can be manipulated as any other object.
Because of that, the name *slot* has been given to the general concept of instance variable in Pharo.
In practice, most of the slots in classes of the system are `InstanceVariableSlot`.
One can create a new kind of slot by subclassing `Slot` class (see [this blogpost](https://medium.com/@juliendelplanque/typed-slots-for-pharo-98ba5d5aafbe) as an example).

## Smalltalk
Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed reflective programming language with multiple implementations. Some implemenations includes [Squeak](#squeak), VisualWorks, Gemstone, VA Smalltalk and many others. Pharo started as an implementation of Smalltalk and is still very close to it.

## Sources (file)
The sources file contains source code of Pharo. Sources file is important because the image file format stores only objects including compiled methods and their bytecode and not their source code. Originally, a new sources file was generated once per major release of Pharo. Now Pharo changed its production mechanisme to be [bootstraped](#bootstrap) and generates a new sources file for each Pharo image produced.

## Spur
Spur is the name of the current object representation in memory of Pharo used by the [virtual machine](#virtual-machine). This representation is used since Pharo 5 and was introduced to improve performances (by 30% compared to the previous implementation) and prepare Pharo to run in 64bits.

## Squeak
Squeak is a dialect of [Smalltalk](#smalltalk). Pharo started as a fork of Squeak and both still share the same [virtual machine](#virtual-machine).

## Super
Super is the [receiver](#receiver) of a [message](#message) an object send to itself, but on the contrary of [self](#self), the method lookup will start in the superclass of a receiver. Super is a unique way for the class to add behavior
to the inherited methods and not just replace them.

## Traits
Traits are pure units of behavior that can be composed to form classes or other traits. The trait composition mechanism is an alternative to multiple or mixin inheritance in which the composer has full control over the trait composition. It enables more reuse than single inheritance without introducing the drawbacks of multiple or mixin inheritance.
A page dedicated to traits is available [here](Traits.md).

## Unary message
An unary message is a [message](#message) where only the [receiver](#receiver) of the message will be involved, which is the reason it is call unary. This means that the message will have no argument. For example, `#factorial` is an unary message that will only involve the number receiving the message.

## VM
See [virtual machine](#virtual-machine).

## Virtual Machine
The virtual machine of Pharo is the execution engine. It takes Pharo bytcode that is generated each time user compiles a piece of code, converts it to machine code and executes it. The VM is different for each platform running Pharo (windows, OSX, linux, arm, 32/64bits) and allows the other part of pharo to be platform independant.
